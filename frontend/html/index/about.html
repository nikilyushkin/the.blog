            In this blog, I explore the intersections of technology, the evolving product landscape, and the art of thriving professionally and personally.
            I’m a tech enthusiast and digital nerd focused on product management / engineering leadership in telco and fintechs.

            I’m passionate about helping people discover the strength and wisdom they already possess—transforming complex, functional environments into dynamic, flexible, and self-organising ecosystems. Today, what excites me most is seeing people come together.
            I get a tremendous sense of fulfillment when teams work joyfully toward business goals while keeping customers at the heart of their efforts.

            In my spare time, I train at the local CrossFit club or enjoy mountain biking in Riverhead with my kid.
            I love the parallels between sports and business—understanding a person’s goals, building effective habits system, and nurturing the right capabilities to reach their potential. It’s incredibly rewarding to see people improve and adapt.
